# binary-bishop

this is a chess bot, 
not so stupid anymore, is now about ~1300 elo, (defeated me once :) )

#
This is not the fastest code, more of a development code (has all logging stuff and testing stuff)... 
Will add the best version directly as a lichess bot soon

#
Main engine with uci protocol works with the test-bot-2.py file! To use, most uci supported chess games accept the .bat/.exe files... I have added the .bat file here (it basically says to use the test-bot-2.py file).
